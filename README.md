# Air Pollution in India
Here I explored the pollution measurements between 1990 to 2015 made at different locations in India. Air pollution is a serious concern in today's world especially in India. 21 out of 30 most polluted cities in the world, are located in India as per 2019 data. The major pollutants are sulfur-dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), suspended particulate matter (SPM), respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM), and particulate matter below 2.5 micrometer (PM2.5). A brief description of each polluatnt is given below.

Sulfur dioxide gas is formed when fuel containing sulfur (mainly coal and oil) is burned (e.g., for electricity generation) and during metal smelting and other industrial processes. High concentrations of SO2 are associated with multiple health and environmental effects. The highest concentrations of SO2 have been recorded in the vicinity of large industrial facilities. SO2 emissions are an important environmental issue because they are a major precursor to ambient PM2.5 concentrations.

Nitrogen dioxide is produced as a result of road traffic and other fossil fuel combustion processes. Its presence in air contributes to the formation and modification of other air pollutants, such as ozone and particulate matter, and to acid rain.

Small suspended particles less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter pose the greatest problems, because they can get deep into your lungs, and some may even get into your bloodstream. Exposure to such particles can affect both your lungs and your heart. Numerous scientific studies have linked particle pollution exposure to a variety of problems, including: premature death in people with heart or lung disease, nonfatal heart attacks, irregular heartbeat, aggravated asthma, decreased lung function, increased respiratory symptoms, such as irritation of the airways, coughing or difficulty breathing and so on.

### Data Cleaning
The unnecessary features and observations are removed or replaced as required. Area type categories and state names were also redefined.

### Data Manipulation
Data were manipulated to see the overall pollution trend with time, at state level and at area level. Also the seasonal variation and correlation among pollutants were explored.
